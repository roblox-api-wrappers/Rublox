# Welcome to the rublox contributing guide

Thank you for taking your time to contribute to our project!

Read our Code of Conduct to keep our community approachable and respectable.

In this guide you will get an overview of the contribution workflow from opening an issue, creating a PR, reviewing, and merging the PR.

## Getting started

### Issues

#### Create a new issue

If you spot a bug with the code, search if an issue already exists. If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue using a relevant issue form.

#### Solve an issue

Look in our existing issues to find one that interests you. You can narrow down the search using [labels](https://github.com/roblox-api-wrappers/rublox/labels) as filters.

### Submitting changes

rublox aims to be supported on versions `>= 3.0` of Ruby.

Before submitting changes, you are expected to lint, document and test your code. We have `rake` commands to aid you.
